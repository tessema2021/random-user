## Lightning Tasks
1. Create a function that will fetch a random user from 
[https://randomuser.me/](https://randomuser.me/). Invoke the function and `console.log` the result.
1. Create a function to display the user information on the DOM with meaningful sections and semantic HTML. Do NOT include the user's login(that would be a silly idea). Be sure to include a picture. Also be sure to convert the date into a human readable format.
1. Create a button that when clicked will invoke these functions and display a new random user. You are creating a single page app (SPA) and therefor the page should not `refresh`.
